# sources/test-tools/xfstests/tests/generic/581

## Purpose

FS QA Test No. generic/581 Test non-root use of the fscrypt filesystem-level encryption keyring and v2 encryption policies.

## Important APIs, Types, and Functions

This is a bash xfstests `generic` case registered with `_begin_fstest auto quick encrypt`. It imports `./common/preamble`, `./common/filter`, `./common/encrypt`. Prerequisite and skip gates include `_require_user`, `_require_scratch_encryption -v 2`. Local helper functions: `_cleanup`. External command surfaces and helper binaries visible in the source include `seq`, `chmod`, `mkdir`, `grep`, `sleep`. Important harness variables and paths include `SCRATCH_MNT`, `seqres.full`, `tmp`, `seq`.

## Control Flow

The script sources `./common/preamble`, installs any custom cleanup, declares feature requirements, prepares the target filesystem, executes a focused regression sequence, and exits with `status=0` only if all checks pass. Representative source-level operations are: `echo`; `_require_user`; `_require_scratch_encryption -v 2`; `_scratch_mkfs_encrypted &>> $seqres.full`; `_scratch_mount`; `raw_key+="\\x$(printf "%02x" $i)"`; `chmod 777 $SCRATCH_MNT`; `_user_do "mkdir $dir"`; `echo "# Setting v1 policy as regular user (should succeed)"`.

## State and Persistence Behavior

The test formats and mounts the scratch filesystem, mutating disposable files under `SCRATCH_MNT`; creates encrypted directories/files and manipulates fscrypt keys or nonce/ciphertext metadata. Cleanup is handled by the preamble and any local `_cleanup` function, commonly removing `$tmp.*`, unmounting/remounting scratch storage, or undoing activated device-mapper, swap, quota, DAX, encryption, or process state.

## Dependencies and Integration Points

The file integrates with the xfstests harness, the `generic` group dispatcher, filesystem-specific `_require_*` probes, and userspace tools such as xfs_io, fsx, fsstress, fscrypt/keyctl, quota tools, device-mapper helpers, or small compiled programs under `$here/src` when referenced. It is intended to be run by the xfstests runner with configured `TEST_DIR`, `SCRATCH_DEV`, and mount/mkfs options rather than as a standalone shell script.

## Risks and Edge Cases

fscrypt policy/key support and raw metadata inspection differ across filesystems and kernel versions. Because stdout is normalized by filters and detailed logs go to `$seqres.full`, apparent behavior can differ between supported filesystems, missing helper binaries, incompatible block sizes, and kernel versions with or without the referenced regression fixes.

## Test Signals

normalized stdout is compared with `generic/581.out`; content dumps/hexdumps expose corruption or unexpected nonzero data; grep-based checks assert expected metadata or data is still visible. Skips from `_require_*` gates are expected on unsupported filesystems or hosts.
