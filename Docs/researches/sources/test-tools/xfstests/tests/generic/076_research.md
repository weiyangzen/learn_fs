# sources/test-tools/xfstests/tests/generic/076

## Purpose

Test blockdev reads in parallel with filesystem reads/writes

## Important APIs, Types, and Functions

This is a bash xfstests case in the `generic` suite. The harness entry and tags are `_begin_fstest metadata rw udf auto quick stress`. Important local functions are `_cleanup`, `_lets_get_pidst`. Key xfstests/helper interfaces include `_scratch_unmount` (unmounts scratch to force persistence checks), `_require_scratch` (requires a disposable scratch filesystem), `_scratch_mount` (mounts the scratch filesystem), `_scratch_mkfs` (formats the scratch filesystem). External or helper commands visible in the body include `fsstress`, `rm`. Significant variables include `FSSTRESS_ARGS`, `status`.

## Control Flow

The script sources `./common/preamble`, `./common/filter`, declares prerequisites, prepares test or scratch storage, runs the scenario, verifies results, and exits with `status=0` only after successful checks. Representative operations are: `_lets_get_pidst()`; `if [ -n "$pid" ]; then`; `_cleanup()`; `_lets_get_pidst`; `rm -f $tmp.*`; `_require_scratch`; `_require_local_device $SCRATCH_DEV`.

## State and Persistence Behavior

The test mutates scratch filesystem contents and metadata, mount/unmount state. Cleanup is mediated by the xfstests preamble and any registered `_cleanup` function, while remounts, explicit syncs, fsck helpers, and comparison steps are used to prove that user data and filesystem metadata survive the exercised operation.

## Dependencies and Integration Points

Prerequisite gates include `_require_local_device`, `_require_scratch`. The test integrates with common xfstests libraries through `./common/preamble`, `./common/filter` and with suite-specific filesystem features selected by the `generic` directory, mount options, mkfs options, and helper binaries.

## Risks and Edge Cases

Risks include destructive scratch-device formatting requires correct harness configuration, timing or background-process races can make failures intermittent, stress-tool behavior and kernel timing can expose nondeterminism. Because this is a filesystem regression test, failures may be caused by kernel bugs, missing userspace helpers, feature-incompatible mkfs/mount options, or environment assumptions rather than shell syntax alone.

## Test Signals

Primary signals: logs detailed diagnostics to `$seqres.full`. Skips are expected when `_require_*` gates reject the host, and failures should leave enough detail in `$seqres.full`, normalized stdout, or harness diagnostics to identify the broken operation.
