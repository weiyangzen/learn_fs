# sources/test-tools/kdevops/playbooks/roles/fstests/defaults/main.yml

## Purpose
Defines default variables for the `fstests` role, which builds and runs xfstests/oscheck workflows across local, block, NFS, CIFS, sparse-file, and NVMe-backed configurations, then copies result artifacts back to the workflow tree. These defaults are the role's configuration contract and determine which tasks are active, where artifacts are stored, and which provider/workflow options are used.

## Important APIs, Types, and Functions
The important interface is the file content itself plus the variables it references from role defaults and playbook inventory. Key variable inputs observed in this file include `data_path`, `kdevops_fstests_setup_name`. The role-level integration surface is the `fstests` variable namespace plus Ansible facts such as distribution family, hostname, groups, and enabled workflow flags.

## Control Flow
There is no runtime control flow in the file; Ansible loads these values before task execution. Downstream tasks branch on these defaults with `when` clauses, use them as template variables, and sometimes replace them with extra vars or generated facts.

## State and Persistence Behavior
State is declarative role configuration. Values persist only as Ansible variables unless later tasks write files, create mounts, start services, or fetch artifacts based on them.

## Dependencies and Integration Points
Integrated as a heavyweight filesystem validation workflow. It depends on distro package roles, kdevops/fstests/xfsprogs/xfsdump git repositories, storage/NFS/SMB/iSCSI helper roles, generated config templates, monitoring tasks, and result-analysis Python scripts.

## Risks
High-risk areas are destructive storage setup, generated config correctness, root environment propagation, ignored oscheck failures, large artifact handling, and post-run expunge augmentation. File-local risk signals: variable or template changes have broad downstream effects because many tasks consume them indirectly.

## Test Signals
Useful test signals include run the role in Ansible check mode where modules support it; exercise the enabled and disabled `when` branches; verify idempotence on a second playbook run; run a small smoke workload; verify remote artifacts are fetched to the expected localhost result directory; check target systemd unit state after the role.
