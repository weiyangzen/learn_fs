# sources/object-store/apache-ozone/hadoop-ozone/fault-injection-test/mini-chaos-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/ozone/failure/package-info.java

Final split target: `Docs/researches/sources/object-store/apache-ozone/hadoop-ozone/fault-injection-test/mini-chaos-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/ozone/failure/package-info.java_research.md`.

## Purpose
Package-level documentation and license anchor for the surrounding Java package. The file has 19 lines and was read in full for this research pass.

## Important APIs, Types, And Functions
Types/classes: `none declared`. Methods and hooks: `none detected`. Test annotations present: `0`.

## Control Flow
The file runs through test/framework lifecycle methods or direct method calls shown above; assertions and helper calls drive observable behavior.

## State And Persistence Behavior
State is mostly test-runtime state: mini-cluster processes, failed-node sets, scheduled futures, executor futures, random key indexes, Ozone buckets/keys/directories, and generated data buffers. Persistence is through Ozone object-store/filesystem writes during the test run.

## Dependencies And Integration Points
only package-level or local module conventions are visible.

## Risks And Edge Cases
- Randomized failure and IO ordering can expose flaky timing, quorum, and readiness assumptions.
- Tests are resource-heavy and marked/unhealthy or fault-injection oriented, so CI runtime and host capacity matter.
- Object-store and filesystem APIs must remain behaviorally aligned for mixed operations.

## Test Signals
Signals come from chaos-test completion, propagated future exceptions, JUnit assertions in `LoadBucket`, mini-cluster readiness waits, and generated test reports.
