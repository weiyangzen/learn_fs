# sources/security-integrity/gocryptfs/tests/matrix/atime_linux.go

Purpose: Integration or regression test file in the matrix tests suite.

Important APIs and types: package `matrix`; functions/tests `extractAtimeMtime`; key imports `syscall`

Control flow: Control enters through Go tests, package initialization, or the functions listed above. The file exercises mounted filesystem behavior, subprocess CLI flows, dirfd-relative syscalls, platform shims, logging, or crypto constructors according to its package.

State and persistence behavior: State is primarily temporary test filesystem state, process-global logger/credential/OpenSSL state, or in-memory crypto/syscall buffers. Persistent effects are limited to config files, mountpoints, sockets, xattrs, benchmark/profile artifacts, or fixture data explicitly created by the tests.

Dependencies and integration points: `syscall`

Risks: platform syscall semantics and kernel/FUSE differences can change behavior.

Test signals: This file is itself a test signal; success means the described regression or compatibility behavior still holds. Assertions and subprocess exit codes in the file provide direct pass/fail evidence.
