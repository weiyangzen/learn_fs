# sources/security-integrity/acl/libacl/acl_to_any_text.c

Purpose: Public formatting wrapper with custom prefix/separator/options. The shared ACL library stores public opaque handles as internal objects tagged with libobj magic values, orders entries in the canonical POSIX ACL sequence, and translates between text, in-memory rings, and Linux `system.posix_acl_*` extended attributes. The file is 33 lines.

Important APIs and functions: Key symbols include `acl_to_any_text`.

Control flow: Delegates to hidden `__acl_to_any_text` using no suffix and returns an allocated string for callers to free with `acl_free`.

State and persistence: Mutated state is usually an in-memory `acl_obj`, `acl_entry_obj`, embedded `acl_permset_obj`, or temporary xattr/text buffer. Path/fd setters and delete helpers persist ACL state to Linux extended attributes or mode bits; pure manipulation helpers only affect caller-owned handles until later applied.

Dependencies and integration points: Depends on private `libacl.h` object macros, `libobj` validation/allocation, POSIX ACL constants, libc allocation/errno, `sys/xattr.h` for filesystem persistence where relevant, `byteorder.h`/`acl_ea.h` for xattr layout, `misc.h` for parsing/lookup/text support, and libattr error-context APIs in permission-copy helpers.

Risks: Handle validation, canonical ordering, iterator state, and errno conventions are cross-cutting invariants. Xattr serializers must preserve little-endian kernel layout, fallback chmod paths must not widen effective permissions, and text/name parsing must treat malformed input as `EINVAL` without leaking partially built ACLs.

Test signals: Unit or integration coverage should exercise valid and malformed ACL handles, canonical ordering, text round trips, xattr get/set/delete on files and directories, unsupported-filesystem fallbacks, mask recalculation/equivalence, named user/group qualifiers, iterator deletion, and `getfacl`/`setfacl` command tests.
