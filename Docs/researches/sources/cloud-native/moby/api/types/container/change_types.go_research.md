## Purpose
Defines Docker container API model API surface for String.

## Important APIs, Types, And Functions
- Exported functions/methods: String.
- Constants: ChangeModify, ChangeAdd, ChangeDelete.

## Control Flow
- Runtime behavior is limited to helper methods such as validators, stringers, comparison functions, sort methods, or error adapters.
- String/error methods expose compact human-readable representations without mutating receiver state.

## State And Persistence
- The file stores no process-local mutable state; structs represent serialized daemon state, request options, or response bodies.
- Persistence is external: Docker daemon stores the actual objects, while these types preserve the wire representation exposed to clients.

## Dependencies And Integration Points
- Integrates as a public `api/types` wire contract used by daemon handlers, client decoding, CLI output, and downstream Go consumers.

## Risks And Edge Cases
- Public API compatibility risk: field names, JSON tags, enum strings, and zero-value behavior are consumed by external clients.

## Test Signals
- Package-level tests include `config_test.go`, `health_test.go`, `hostconfig_test.go`, `hostconfig_unix_test.go`, `state_test.go`.
