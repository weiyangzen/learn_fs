# sources/distributed-fs/ceph-client/arch/arm/include/asm/exception.h

### Purpose
`sources/distributed-fs/ceph-client/arch/arm/include/asm/exception.h` marks exception entry/exit
functions with ARM-specific asmlinkage attributes. It is part of the ARM kernel-architecture
compatibility layer imported in the Ceph client source tree, so its direct consumers are kernel
architecture, MM, interrupt, driver, and board-support code rather than Ceph protocol logic.

### Important APIs, Types, And Functions
macros: `__exception_irq_entry`. The file is 15 lines / 416 bytes, and the exported surface is
primarily an include-time contract for other kernel files.

### Control Flow
IRQ/FIQ helpers are normally used from early boot, interrupt entry, or low-level driver paths where
callers must already understand local interrupt state.

### State, Persistence, And Dependencies
The header itself has no storage or filesystem persistence; it contributes compile-time constants
and inline code. There is no userspace filesystem persistence in this file; persistence is either
kernel memory, CPU register state, hardware register state, or generated ABI values. Direct includes
are `linux/interrupt.h`. It integrates with generic Linux ARM architecture code through include-time
contracts rather than a standalone translation unit. Interrupt-related declarations integrate with
generic irqchip, exception entry, and per-CPU irq accounting code.

### Integration Points
The header is included by ARM architecture implementation files, board/platform code, low-level
drivers, and generic Linux subsystems that need the ARM-specific version of `exception.h`. In the
distributed filesystem tree this matters indirectly: the Ceph client can only rely on networking,
page cache, DMA, fault handling, and scheduler primitives if these architecture hooks compile and
behave correctly for the target ARM kernel configuration.

### Risks
callers must preserve interrupt-state assumptions and avoid using low-level helpers from preemptible
or wrong-context paths.

### Test Signals
exercise boot, interrupt entry/exit, and irqchip paths; ensure all include users still build with
sparse/objtool-style diagnostics where available.
