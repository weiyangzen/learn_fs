# sources/distributed-fs/ceph-client/arch/nios2/include/asm/syscalls.h

Purpose: declares Nios II-specific syscall wrappers before including generic syscall prototypes.

Important APIs/types/functions: prototypes: `Corporation`; macros: `__ASM_NIOS2_SYSCALLS_H`.

Control flow: This header is consumed at compile time by generic Linux, low-level assembly, and architecture C
code; its macros/types are expanded into syscall, MM, signal, ptrace, or build-time contracts rather
than running standalone.

State and persistence: The file has little durable storage of its own; effects flow through architecture globals, hardware
registers, task structures, or generic subsystem state owned by callers.

Dependencies and integration points: Dependencies include `asm-generic/syscalls.h`. Integration points include generic Linux MM, irq,
signal, ptrace, module, timekeeping, devicetree, syscall, and cache/TLB subsystems plus Nios II
control-register assembly. This source is part of the Nios II architecture port under the vendored
ceph-client kernel tree.

Risks: Risks include architecture-specific assumptions about alignment, endianness, cache geometry, control
registers, compiler output, and boot/devicetree data.

Test signals: Test signals are syscall ABI tests, strace/ptrace, signal delivery and sigreturn tests, KGDB
breakpoint handling, interrupt/preemption stress, illegal/alignment exception tests, and user/kernel
register dump sanity.
